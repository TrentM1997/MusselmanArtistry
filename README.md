# My first Freelance gig

This is the first site I've ever produced for a client. It was a huge learning opportunity for me
and really solidified a lot of the questions I had about the process of putting together a functioning 
web-app, and carrying that project through start to finish. The client wanted a clean, simplistic design that 
looked elegant, but didn't take away from the art actually being showcased and sold on the site.
